# ðŸŽ¬ IMDB Movies Dataset Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project provides a **cleaned version of the IMDB movies dataset** along with exploratory data analysis.  
The original dataset contained multiple genres in a single row. We **exploded genres** into individual rows, making it easier to analyze genre-level insights.  

The analysis includes:  
- Cleaning and preprocessing of raw movie data  
- Genre distribution and counts  
- Average ratings and revenues by genre  
- Visualization of **revenue vs. rating** by genre
